This directory should contain the following Python files:
* autoencoders.py
* model_v1.py
* model_v2.py


Purpose of scripts:
* **autoencoders.py** = Class for creating a convolutional autoencoder. Takes sequential model as parameter.
* **model_v1.py** = V1 sequential model used in training. The one used in thesis results.
* **model_v2.py** = V2 sequential model used originally (first try). Was not working well enought for the purpose.
