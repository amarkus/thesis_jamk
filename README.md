# Master's thesis source code
Final version of the source code implemented for Markus Aukeala's Master's thesis in Jamk University of Applied Sciences, Jyväskylä, Finland (Master's Degree Programme in Information Technology, Cyber Security).

For archival purposes only, this source code repository will not be further developed.
You may use the source code according to the license.

If you use the code, it would be nice to include link/reference to my thesis [Practical Attack and Defense Methods for Integrity of Deep Neural Networks in Digital Pathology Image Analysis Systems](https://www.theseus.fi/handle/10024/855211).
